# Used Libraries
## awesome-wm-nice

Currently using [raven2cz' fork](https://github.com/raven2cz/awesome-wm-nice)
instead of [mut-ex' original library](https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice)
as [#22](https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice/issues/22) remains unfixed.

_(raven2cz opened a [pull request](https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice/pull/25)
for this a while ago, but it remains unmerged)_
